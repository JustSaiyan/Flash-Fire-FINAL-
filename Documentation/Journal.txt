January 10th, 2018:
- Attempted to make menu screen for MoveSprite, failed to build
- After changing setScreen in GamMoveSprite from ScrMoveSprite to ScrPlay, build is successful, but runs for
  about a milisecond (Unplayable)
- Copy and pasted asssests from MoveSprite - Copy to MenuButton2 - Copy 2, build successful, menu and game works

January 11th, 2018:
- MoveSprite now switches to ScrGameover when player loses all their lives
- When on ScrGameover, pressing the play button just switches you back to ScrGameover
  instead of switching to ScrPlay

January 15th, 2018:
- Got projectile to spawn in and make a sound when pressing the Spacebar, but doesn't move

January 18th, 2018:
- While messing around with iterators the projectile sprite moves to where you collect the dots, 
  projectile sprite spawns seratically when holding down the Space bar and dots don't spawn until you spawn the
  projectile sprite. Basically, the game's busted at the moment.
- Got rid of some pointless code, game slightly more stable, but still busted.

January 19th, 2018:
- Commented out all code affiliated with the dots to make it so there is no way to somehow add both together and
  so that it's easier to test everything
- Able to shoot projectile across the screen, finally
- Made different music play depending on what screen the player is on

January 22nd, 2018:
- Offically changed the project name to Flash Fire (Better than MenuButton2, right?)
- Projectile now shoots from the Hero sprite (A lot easier to do than I thought.....)

January 23rd, 2018:
- Made sprEnemy move around the screen in a set pattern, although made it so that his hitbox is messed up
- Changed sprHero to spawn in the middle of the screeen

January 24th, 2018:
- Fixed issue with sprEnemy hitbox so that when the enemy is shot, player will get points
- Made sprHero spawn back in the corner which somehow made him get 2 red bars below his feet
